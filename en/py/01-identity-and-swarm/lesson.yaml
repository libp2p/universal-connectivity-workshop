title: Identity and Basic Host
description: >
  In this lesson, we will learn how to create a basic libp2p host and set up 
  cryptographic identity for our peer. We will explore the concept of PeerId 
  generation using Ed25519 keypairs and understand the foundations of 
  peer-to-peer identity in distributed systems.
