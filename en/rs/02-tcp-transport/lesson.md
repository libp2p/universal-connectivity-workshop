# Lesson 2: Transport Layer - TCP Connection

Building on your basic libp2p node, in this lesson you'll now learn about transport layers and establish your first peer-to-peer connections using TCP with Noise and Yamux.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Understand libp2p's transport abstraction
- Configure TCP transport with security and multiplexing
- Establish a connection to a remote peer

## Background: Transport Layers in libp2p

In libp2p, **transports** handle the low-level network communication. A transport defines how data travels between peers. libp2p supports multiple transports:

- **TCP**: Reliable, ordered, connection-oriented (like HTTP)
- **QUIC**: Modern UDP-based with built-in encryption
- **WebRTC**: For browser connectivity
- **Memory**: For testing and local communication

Each transport can be enhanced with:
- **Security protocols**: Encrypt communication (e.g. Noise, TLS)
- **Multiplexers**: Share one connection for multiple streams (Yamux, Mplex)

## Transport Stack

The libp2p stack looks like the following when using TCP, Noise, and Yamux:

```
Application protocols (ping, gossipsub, etc.)
    ↕
Multiplexer (Yamux)
    ↕
Security (Noise)
    ↕
Transport (TCP)
    ↕
Network (IP)
```

## Your Task

Extend your application to:
1. Parse remote peer addresses from an environment variable
2. Establish a connection to a remote peer
3. Print connection events for verification

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Add Imports

In your `src/main.rs`, ensure you have the necessary imports. You must import `Multiaddr` for handling addresses and `SwarmEvent` for handling connection events. You must also add in the `str::FromStr` trait and `env` module for reading environment variables and parsing the values into Multiaddrs.

```rust
use anyhow::Result;
use futures::StreamExt;
use libp2p::{
    identity, noise, ping, tcp, yamux,
    Multiaddr, SwarmBuilder,
    swarm::{NetworkBehaviour, SwarmEvent}
};
use std::{env, str::FromStr, time::Duration};
```

### Step 2: Parse the Multiaddr from Environment Variable

In this workshop, one or more `Multiaddr` strings for remote peers is passed in the environment variable `REMOTE_PEERS`. It is important to note that the values in `REMOTE_PEERS` are not IP addresses but rather `Multiaddr` strings. A `Multiaddr` string looks like: `/ip4/172.16.16.17/tcp/9092`.

To parse the list of `Multiaddr` strings, add the following code to your `main` function. This will read the `REMOTE_PEERS` environment variable, split it by commas, trim whitespace, filter out empty strings, and parse each string into a `Multiaddr`. If parsing fails, it returns an error.

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    println!("Starting Universal Connectivity application...");

    // parse the remote peer addresses from the environment variable
    let mut remote_addrs: Vec<Multiaddr> = Vec::default();
    if let Ok(remote_peers) = env::var("REMOTE_PEERS") {
        remote_addrs = remote_peers
            .split(',')                         // Split the string at ','
            .map(str::trim)                     // Trim whitespace of each string
            .filter(|s| !s.is_empty())          // Filter out empty strings
            .map(Multiaddr::from_str)           // Parse each string into Multiaddr
            .collect::<Result<Vec<_>, _>>()?;   // Collect into Result and unwrap it
    }
    
    // ... existing code ...
}
```

### Step 3: Add Code to Dial the Remote Peer

Right after you build your `swarm` and right before you enter the event loop, you must add the code to dial the remote peer addresses:
    
```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    println!("Starting Universal Connectivity application...");

    // ... existing code initialize and build the swarm ...

    // Dial all of the remote peer Multiaddrs
    for addr in remote_addrs.into_iter() {
        swarm.dial(addr)?;
    }

    // ... existing event loop code ...
}
```

If you run your peer now, nothing happens because even though you dialed the remote peer, you haven't set up any event handling to see the connection events.

### Step 4: Update Your Event Loop

By default, a libp2p swarm will emit events when it starts listening, connects to peers, or encounters errors. You need to handle these events in your event loop. The connection related swarm events are all documented here in [enum SwarmEvent](https://docs.rs/libp2p/0.55.0/libp2p/swarm/enum.SwarmEvent.html).

For now, we only care about the `ConnectionEstablished`, `ConnectionClosed`, and `OutgoingConnectionError` events because they will tell us if our dial succeeded or failed and when a connection has been closed. In this lesson, you only have to dial the remote peer, so you don't need to handle incoming connections yet. When you check your solution, a remote peer is started using Docker and if you successfully connect to it, it will gracefully close the connection. You do not need to do anything other than what is shown below.

Add the following code to your event loop to handle connection events caused by dialing a remote peer:

```rust
loop {
    tokio::select! {
        Some(event) = swarm.next() => match event {
            SwarmEvent::ConnectionEstablished { peer_id, endpoint, .. } => {
                println!("Connected to: {peer_id} via {}", endpoint.get_remote_address());
            }
            SwarmEvent::ConnectionClosed { peer_id, cause, .. } => {
                if let Some(err) = cause {
                    println!("Connection to {peer_id} closed with error: {err}");
                } else {
                    println!("Connection to {peer_id} closed gracefully");
                }
            }
            SwarmEvent::OutgoingConnectionError { peer_id, error, .. } => {
                println!("Failed to connect to {peer_id:?}: {error}");
            }
            _ => {}
        }
    }
}
```

After making these changes to your peer, hit the `c` key to check your solution. If you did everything correctly, your peer will dial the remote peer and print connection events when it connects or disconnects.

## Testing Your Implementation

If you are using the workshop tool to take this workshop, you only have to hit the `c` key to check your solutionto see if it is correct. However if you would like to test your solution manually, you can follow these steps. The `PROJECT_ROOT` environment variable is the path to your Rust project. The `LESSON_PATH` for this lesson is most likely `.workshops/universal-conectivity-workshop/en/rs/02-tcp-transport`.

1. Set the environment variables:
   ```bash
   export PROJECT_ROOT=/path/to/workshop
   export LESSON_PATH=en/rs/02-tcp-transport
   ```

2. Change into the lesson directory:
    ```bash
    cd $PROJECT_ROOT/$LESSON_PATH
    ```

3. Run with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker rm -f workshop-lesson ucw-checker-02-tcp-transport
   docker network rm -f workshop-net
   docker network create --driver bridge --subnet 172.16.16.0/24 workshop-net
   docker compose --project-name workshop up --build --remove-orphans
   ```

4. Run the Python script to check your output:
   ```bash
   python check.py
   ```

## Success Criteria

Your implementation should:
- ✅ Display the startup message and local peer ID
- ✅ Successfully parse remote peer addresses from the environment variable
- ✅ Successfully dial the remote peer
- ✅ Establish a connection and print connection messages

## What's Next?

Excellent! You've successfully configured TCP transport and established peer-to-peer connections. You now understand:

- **Transport Layer**: How libp2p handles network communication
- **Security**: Noise protocol for encrypted connections  
- **Multiplexing**: Yamux for sharing connections
- **Connection Management**: Handling incoming and outgoing connections
- **Event-Driven Programming**: Responding to network events

In the next lesson, you'll add your first protocol (ping) and connect to the instructor's server for your first checkpoint!

Key concepts you've learned:
- **libp2p Transport Stack**: TCP + Noise + Yamux
- **Connection Events**: Establishment, closing, and errors
- **Listening and Dialing**: Acting as both client and server
- **Multiaddresses**: libp2p's addressing format

Next up: Adding the ping protocol and achieving your first checkpoint!
