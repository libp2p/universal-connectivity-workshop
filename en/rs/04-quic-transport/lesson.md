# Lesson 4: QUIC Transport

Now that you understand TCP transport, let's explore QUIC - a modern UDP-based transport protocol that provides built-in encryption and multiplexing. You'll learn about libp2p's multi-transport capabilities by connecting to a remote peer with both TCP and QUIC simultaneously.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will:
- Understand the advantages of QUIC over TCP
- Configure multi-transport libp2p nodes
- Handle connections over different transport protocols
- Connect to remote peers using QUIC multiaddresses

## Background: QUIC Transport

QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) is a modern transport protocol that offers several advantages over TCP:

- **Built-in Security**: Encryption is integrated into the protocol (no separate TLS layer needed)
- **Reduced Latency**: Fewer round-trips for connection establishment
- **Better Multiplexing**: Streams don't block each other (no head-of-line blocking)
- **Connection Migration**: Connections can survive network changes
- **UDP-based**: Can traverse NATs more easily than TCP

## Transport Comparison

Remember back in Lesson 2, you learned that the libp2p stack looks like the following when using TCP, Noise, and Yamux:

```
Application protocols (ping, gossipsub, etc.)
    ↕
Multiplexer (Yamux)
    ↕
Security (Noise)
    ↕
Transport (TCP)
    ↕
Network (IP)
```

In this lesson you will add the ability to connect to remote peers using the QUIC transport. Because it has integrated encryption and multiplexing, the libp2p stack looks like the following when using QUIC:

```
Application protocols (ping, gossipsub, etc.)
    ↕
──────────────┐
Multiplexer   │
Security    (QUIC)
Transport     │
──────────────┘
    ↕
Network (IP)
```

## Your Task

Extend your ping application to support both TCP and QUIC transports:

1. **Add QUIC Transport**: Configure QUIC alongside your existing TCP transport
2. **Multi-Transport Configuration**: Create a swarm that can handle both protocols
3. **Connect via QUIC**: Use a QUIC multiaddress to connect to the remote peer
4. **Handle Transport Events**: Display connection information for both transports

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Update Dependencies

Add QUIC support to your Cargo.toml features:

```toml
[dependencies]
libp2p = { version = "0.56", features = ["ed25519", "macros", "noise", "ping", "quic", "tcp", "tokio", "yamux"] }
```

Note the addition of the "quic" feature.

### Step 2: Configure Multi-Transport Swarm

Modify your code for building the swarm by adding in `.with_quic()` just after the `.with_tcp(...)`. That will initialize the QUIC transport infrastructure and add it to the swarm.

```rust
let mut swarm = SwarmBuilder::with_existing_identity(local_key)
    .with_tokio()
    .with_tcp(
        tcp::Config::default(),
        noise::Config::new,
        yamux::Config::default,
    )?
    .with_quic()
    .with_behaviour(|_| Behaviour {
        ping: ping::Behaviour::new(
            ping::Config::new()
                .with_interval(Duration::from_secs(1))
                .with_timeout(Duration::from_secs(5))
        ),
    })?
    .with_swarm_config(|c| c.with_idle_connection_timeout(Duration::from_secs(60)))
    .build();
```

### Step 3: Connect Using QUIC

You will use the same dialing code from Lesson 2 and 3, but this time, the `REMOTE_PEERS` environment variable will be initialized with a QUIC multiaddr, so without any other code changes, your peer will dial the remote peer with QUIC. QUIC Multiaddrs look like: `/ip4/172.16.16.17/udp/9091/quic-v1`

### Step 4: Handle Connection Events

Your existing event handling code will work for both TCP and QUIC connections. The multiaddress in the connection events will show which transport was used.

## Testing Your Implementation

1. Set the environment variables:
   ```bash
   export PROJECT_ROOT=/path/to/workshop
   export LESSON_PATH=en/rs/04-quic-transport
   ```

2. Change into the lesson directory:
    ```bash
    cd $PROJECT_ROOT/$LESSON_PATH
    ```

3. Run with Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker rm -f workshop-lesson ucw-checker-04-quic-transport
   docker network rm -f workshop-net
   docker network create --driver bridge --subnet 172.16.16.0/24 workshop-net
   docker compose --project-name workshop up --build --remove-orphans
   ```

4. Run the Python script to check your output:
   ```bash
   python check.py
   ```

## Success Criteria

Your implementation should:
- ✅ Display the startup message and local peer ID
- ✅ Successfully dial the remote peer using QUIC
- ✅ Establish a QUIC connection
- ✅ Send and receive ping messages over QUIC
- ✅ Display round-trip times in milliseconds

## Hints

## Hint - QUIC Multiaddress Format

QUIC multiaddresses use UDP instead of TCP and include the QUIC protocol after the port number.
- TCP: `/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/9092`
- QUIC: `/ip4/127.0.0.1/udp/9092/quic-v1`

            .filter(|s| !s.is_empty())          // Filter out empty strings
            .map(Multiaddr::from_str)           // Parse each string into Multiaddr
            .collect::<Result<Vec<_>, _>>()?;   // Collect into Result and unwrap it
    }

    // Generate a random Ed25519 keypair for our local peer
